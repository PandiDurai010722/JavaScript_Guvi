.Google Chrome 

  > Blink 

   a. Fork of Webkit 

   b  C++ 

   c  Developed in house by  Google  as part  of  the Chromium Project "to open- source the code for the Google Chrome browser "

   d.https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aitSOucL0VHZa9Z2vbRJSyAlsAz24kX8LFByQ5xQnUg/edit


.V8

   .Chakara
    - Open-sourcec as ChakraCore.
    - In 2016,Microsoft  created  a PR in the Node.Js GitHub repo to use ChakaraCore 
       instead of  V8. This PR was expanded out into its own project and now lives here as a project of the node organization.
.Opera 

   .Blink 
     - Fork of Webkit.Part of Chrome 
     .V8s 
       .if something works on Google Chrome,you can expect it to work on Opera due to the identical rendering engine + JavaScript engine used.
